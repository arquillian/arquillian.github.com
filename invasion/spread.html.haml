  Help spreak Ike around the world. Grab a logo and use it to promote Ike's message:

  bq. Don't mock me. Write real tests!

  The artwork for JBoss Community projects is created by the JBoss design team. The "Arquillian artwork":http://design.jboss.org/arquillian includes a logo, an icon ("named Ike":/blog/2010/07/03/ike-a-developer-magnet-at-judcon-jboss-world), mood icons, and a desktop wallpaper. You can also get "swag":http://www.cafepress.com/jbossorg/7125835 (t-shirts, stickers, mugs, etc...) printed with the logo or icon.

  h3. Emotional Ike

  Ike is an emotional character. He cheers when the built succeeds, but gets down, sometimes furious, when the build fails. We've created icons to reflect his emotional state. Look for them in the build indicator box on the right and in the reference guide.
