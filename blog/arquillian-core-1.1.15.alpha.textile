title: Welcome JUnit Rules for Arquillian
---

We have released yet another version of Arquillian Core. This time with one new feature.

h3. What's new?

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **JUnit Rules For Arquillian**

p. If you want to use Arquillian Testing Platform with other JUnit Runner, you can now use JUnit Rules - `ArquillianTestClass` and `ArquillianTest` -
   and happily let Arquillian do the heavy lifting for your tests.

p. To get the similar functionality what the `@RunWith(Arquillian.class)` is offering you should require both rules i.e. `ArquillianTestClass` and `ArquillianTest`.

bc(prettify).. @ClassRule
 public static ArquillianTestClass arquillianTestClass = new ArquillianTestClass();

 @Rule
 public ArquillianTest arquillianTest = new ArquillianTest();

 @Deployment
 public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
     return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class)
         .addClass(Greeter.class)
         .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
 }

 @Inject
 Greeter greeter;

 @Test
 public void should_greet_earthlings() throws Exception {
     String name = "Earthlings";
     Assert.assertEquals("Hello, " + name, greeter.greet(name));
 }

p.In order to use any other JUnit Class or Method Rule with `ArquillianClassTest` or `ArquillianTest` Rule, you have to use it with `RuleChain`
  having `ArquillianClassTest` or `ArquillianTest` as outer Rule. e.g.
  bc(prettify).. @Rule
     public MethodRule testWatchman = MethodRuleChain.outer(new ArquillianTest().around(new TestWatchman());

p. Arquillian is not enforcing user to define both rules as implementations of `MethodRuleChain` is different for different users.
 JUnit doesn't provide `MethodRuleChain` similar to the `RuleChain`, as we don't know your implementation of `MethodRuleChain`,
 we can't check if your MethodRuleChain has `ArquillianTest` Rule defined.

p. Arquillian is providing `MethodRuleChain` which is RuleChain for `MethodRules`. Feel free to use it.

p. Do you want to play around this?
