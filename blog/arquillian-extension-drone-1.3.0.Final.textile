h3. Removal of mobile related capabilities

Arquillian Drone 1.3.0.Final was migrated to user Selenium 2.40.0. While this version brings you support for the newest browsers, it has dropped support for
*android* and *iphone* drivers. This change affected also Graphene 2, so make sure that you use Graphene 2.0.2.Final together with Drone 1.3.0.Final.

The gap will be closed by future release of Arquillian Drodium, where we will bring test support for all native, hybrid and mobile wep applications. 
iOS testing support gap closure will take us a bit longer, unfortunately. If you need to test on mobile devices, please keep using Arquillian Drone 1.2.4.Final.
If you want latest and greatest stuff for desktop browsers, go for Drone 1.3.0.Final.

We hope that you'll enjoy our new stuff and look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
