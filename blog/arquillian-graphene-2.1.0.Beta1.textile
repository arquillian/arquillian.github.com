Apart from many bug fixes and components upgrades, this release also contains a new feature: 
<i class="icon-star"></i> @Page injection is newly supported also for parameter injection in test methods. So you can use:

@Test
public void pageTest(@Page TestPage page) {
...
}

This could make your test cases more compact.
