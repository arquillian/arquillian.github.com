This is the very first release of ShrinkWrap Resolver 3.0.0 release chain. During the next releases we are aiming to provide you a new API of MavenImporter, a possibility to resolve only metadata and much more.

This release doesn't provide any new implementation features, but more likely important component updates and significant refactoring changes:

h3. Removed deprecated code from ShrinkWrap Resolver

This is the only change that significantly influences the implementation logic. Since the ShrinkWrap Resolver has experienced rapid development and many changes on the field of API during last several releases, it has happened that some of the functions had to be deprecated. In this release all the @@Deprecated@ code from previous releases has been removed.

h3. Maven 3.3.9 & JDK 1.7

There has been upgraded several components in this release, but the most important is the upgrade of Maven to 3.3.9. The thing is that Maven 3.3 requires JDK 1.7 or above to execute, which means that ShrinkWrap Resolver 3.0.0 won't be possible to run on lower versions of Java.

h3. Refactoring

Apart from huge cleanup across all poms and removal of deprecated classes/methods, there has been also refactored the project structure - all Gradle and Maven modules have been moved to separated directories. This technically doesn't influence the end user anyhow, because both the GroupId and the ArtifactId stayed same.

We hope that you'll enjoy our new stuff and look forward to hear your feedback.
