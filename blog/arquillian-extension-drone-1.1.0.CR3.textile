Arquillian Drone reaches 1.1.0.CR3 version.

After some experiments with configuration simplification, we realized that current possibilites (and for that point, implementation as well) are too complicated. While @browserCapabilities@ allowed you to ignore implementation class of WebDriver, you were still required to remember how to set up various capabilities.

Therefore, we are offering you a way how to set up capabilities directly as they are. So, we dropped capability configuration support as you knew it from CR1 and CR2, replacing it with something much easier to use.

h3(highlights). Some of the highlights in this release

<i class="icon-star"></i> Direct capability mapping. Think of any WebDriver capability, such as @opera.no_restart@ or @acceptSSLCerts@. Now you can specify them directly in arquillian.xml:

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <property name="browserCapabilities">firefox</property>
    <property name="opera.no_restart">true</property>
    <property name="acceptSSLCerts">false</property>
</extension>

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> Deprecated Arquillian Drone system properties configuration in favor of Arquillian Core one. The deprecated way shows a bunch of warning, but it still works:

In previous @arquilian.xml@ snippet, @browserCapabilities@ would map to @arquillian.webdriver.browser.capabilities@. The correct way how to override this property is now @arq.extension.webdriver.browserCapabilities@. This approach also allow you to specify @arquillian.properties@ system property, which point to a file where the properties are stored.

The same change happened for qualifiers support. For following arquillian.xml snippet you now use @arq.extension.webdriver-myqualifier.browserCapabilities@ instead of legacy @arquillian.webdriver.myqualifier.browser.capabilities@:

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver-myqualifier">
    <property name="browserCapabilities">chrome</property>
</extension>

p. We hope that this would make Arquillian Drone usage simpler, especially for people who have already tried to use @browserCapabilities@.

We look forward to hearing your feedback about this release in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}!
