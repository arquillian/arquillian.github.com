We are proud to announce new features in this release for Arquillian Governor:

h3. New Features

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Arquillian Recorder integration with Arquillian Governor:=

p. In this release we are providing recorder integration with Jira, GitHub & Redmine Governor.

p. Arquillian Recorder project brings neat reports for your Arquillian tests. Arquillian Governor Extension gives you the possibility to programmatically choose what test methods of your Arquillian tests are going to be executed and what are going to be skipped by putting your custom annotations on the test methods. The resolution of the test method execution is done during the test class execution in BeforeClass phase.

p. We are providing an integration of Recorder with Govenor so that generated report contains information about JIRA, GitHub and Redmine properties such as Issue URL, Force value, Detector & it's strategy used for environment, force value using which Arquillian Governor decides execution of test method. Let's see it in action for Arquillian Jira Governor:

bc(prettify).. @RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class TestCase
{
    @Test
    @Jira("ARQ-5000", force = true)
    public void automaticClosingTest()
    {
        // when this JIRA exists and its status is 'Unresolved' / 'Open'
        // and you have forced its execution and you set 'closePassed'
        // property in arquillian.xml to 'true', if this test method succeeds,
        // it automatically resolves respective JIRA issue as 'Done'
    }

    @Test
    @Jira(value = "ARQ-1000", detector = @Detector(Windows.class))
    public void conditionalTest()
    {
        // This test case will be executed on all operation systems except for Windows.
        // If the current OS is Windows then the status of JIRA issue will be checked.
    }
}

p. If you see in above test, methods are annotated with Jira Issue ID, Force value & Environment Detector's. If you run above test by adding @arquillin-recorder@ dependency mentioned below then generated report by recorder will give you all information used to decide execution of test method i.e. Jira Issue URL, Force value, Detector & it's strategy.
