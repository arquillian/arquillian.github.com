p. We have just released new version of Transaction Extension with two important improvements. First of all we have noticed unexpected behaviour when using embedded containers. To make the long story short - transactions where not handled properly in some cases. In addition we changed the way how configuration is loaded. It is now handled in the more appropriate moment - when descriptors are loaded (not before the test suite as it was before). Many thanks to "PÃ«tr Andreev":https://github.com/petrandreev for spotting the latter and sending a pull request!
