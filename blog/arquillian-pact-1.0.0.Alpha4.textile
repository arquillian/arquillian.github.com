p. Arquillian Pact is an extension for writing contract-driven tests providing you seamless integration with well known "Pact":https://docs.pact.io/ framework.

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **@@Pact@ annotation can be used at class level**

p. You can use @@Pact@ annotation at the class level, so methods that defines a pact fragment, just need to return @PactFragment@ object. In case of setting annotation at the class and method level, the one defined on the method will take precedence.

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Pact Publisher properties configuration**

p. You can configure Pact Publisher properties using Java System properties or Environment variables using Arquillian syntax. Any property value can be set using Java system property @${name:defaultValue}@ or using environment variable @${env.name:defaultValue}@. @defaulValue@ will be used in case referred property is not defined.

h3. Bug fixing

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Using @skipDeployment@ with Wildfly Swarm returns a NPE**

p. Skipping deployment for WildFly Swarm was result with NPE. This is because our URL provider was conflicting with the one Swarm implements.  This is has beein fixed in "issue-44":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/issues/44

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **Pact Publisher is not called when used with Gradle**

p. Pact Publisher is not called when used with Gradle due to a bug in Gradle https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-3411 . Since Publisher reacts to @AfterSuite@ and this event is not emitted when running in Gradle, we changed it to @AfterClass@. This has slight impact on the performance publishing pacts after each test execution instead of once in a bulk.  "issue-43":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/issues/43
