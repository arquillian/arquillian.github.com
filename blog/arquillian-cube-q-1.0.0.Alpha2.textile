p. This release of Arquillian Cube Q contains one new feature that allows you to add some randomness on some toxics values, using mathematical distributions. Currently only uniform distribution and log normal distribution are supported.

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Example using Log Normal distribution :=

bc(prettify).. networkChaos.on("pingpong", 8080)
    .latency(logNormalLatencyInMillis(2000, 0.3))
    .exec(times(2), () -> {

        URL url = new URL("http://" + ip + ":" + 8081 + "/hw/HelloWorld");
        final long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
        String response = IOUtil.asString(url.openStream());

    });

p. In the configuration above, latency times are distributed in using a log normal distribution with median of 2 seconds and 0.3 as sigma value. Then for each iteration of the test, a new value is calculated and send to toxiproxy.
