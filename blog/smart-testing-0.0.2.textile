h3. Highlights of this release

p. After a week since our very first release we have a brand new one! This time with several improvements and bug fixes, namely:

  * simplified installation process
  * hinting available strategies when misspelled in the configuration
  * improved documentation

h3. Simplified getting started

p. Even though installation process is very simple, we are huge fans of automation. So we created one liner which will take care of adding Smart Testing to your project.

p. Simply execute following snippet and you are ready to go.

bc(prettify).. $ curl -sSL https://git.io/vdv4j | bash

h3. Hinting available strategies

p. It might happen that you misspell a strategy when executing the build. For example:

bc(prettify).. $ mvn clean verify -Dsmart.testing=new,change,afected

p. This will lead to a failing build, but instead of leaving you with not just an exception thrown at your face and documentation to dig into, we are now hinting to matching strategies. With @0.0.2@ you will see instead:

bc(prettify).. Unable to find strategy [afected]. Did you mean [affected]?
Unable to find strategy [change]. Did you mean [changed]?

h3. What's next

We are working hard on the next release which will bring simplified configuration and many more cool features! Stay tuned!
