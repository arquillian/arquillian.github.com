p. Finally first none alpha version of Arquillian Cube 1.0.0 has been released. Alpha versions where totally usable but now we feel confident with the internal API so no break-back compatibilty new version is going to release soon.

p. Also we are going to start using "Semantic Versioning":http://semver.org/ in Arquillian Cube. For this reason there is no @Arquillian Cube 1.0.0.Final@ but @Arquillian Cube 1.0.0@

h3. What's new

p. <i class="icon-star"></i> **OpenShift Client Resource Provider**

p. OpenShift test can be enriched with @OpenShiftClient@ instance.

bc(prettify).. public class HelloWorldTest {

    @ArquillianResource
    OpenShiftClient client;

}
