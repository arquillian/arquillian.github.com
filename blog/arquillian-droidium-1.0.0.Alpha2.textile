There are several important fixes in this release for those testing Android native and web applications in connection with Arquillian Drone and Graphene.

This release is packed with bugfixes and features which make testing experience more smooth. Arquillian Droidium container can be from now on used as a standalone container which does not depend on any plugin, native nor web. Even no plugin is on class path, you can still deploy APKs to Android device and you can fully interact with your device and automate it as you wish. Only sky is the limit ...

Arquillian Droidium uses Arquillian Drone and Graphene extensions heavilly. Among the most interesting features in this release is the possibility to use Page fragments from Graphene even on your native Android activities so there is almost zero difference between functional web and Android native application testing. Since you can use ordinary application container and Droidium container together in one test run, you can from now on test complex scenarios which require interaction between web application and Android application.

We look forward to hearing your feedback about this release in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}!
