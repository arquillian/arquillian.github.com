The is the first and probably also last Beta release where we focused on stabilization and documentation:

h3(highlights). Highlighted Changes

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Stabilization of API := 
In Beta1, we have stabilized API and removed all parts deprecated in Alpha5. The API is now considered final and there is no intention to change it on a way to Final release.
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Getting Started Guide := 
Thanks to the amazing effort of "Juraj HÃºska":https://github.com/jhuska, we were able to rewrite original "Functional Testing using Drone":/guides/functional_testing_using_drone/ guide to use Graphene 2. Even though it is targetting beginners in Selenium WebDriver usage, it teaches you best practices so you will write maintainable and efficient functional tests from beginning.
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Reference Documentation := 
The "Reference Documentation":https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQGRA2/Home was completed so that it reflects all features which are part of Graphene 2.0.
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> JavaDoc for API and SPI Available Online := 
We have finalized documentation of Java classes for "API":https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/jboss_releases_staging_profile-1630/archive/org/jboss/arquillian/graphene/graphene-webdriver-api/2.0.0.Beta1/graphene-webdriver-api-2.0.0.Beta1-javadoc.jar/!/index.html and "SPI":https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/jboss_releases_staging_profile-1630/archive/org/jboss/arquillian/graphene/graphene-webdriver-spi/2.0.0.Beta1/graphene-webdriver-spi-2.0.0.Beta1-javadoc.jar/!/index.html and made them available online. You can bookmark those links since they won't change in upcoming stable Graphene releases!
=:

h3. Final is due soon!

We are now pretty done, and unless we all together identify any serious issues or find interoperability problems, we will release a candidate for Final release in a week, followed by a @2.0.0.Final@ shortly.

So, be sure to check the @Beta@ release out, so that you won't hit any regressions once we get Final!
