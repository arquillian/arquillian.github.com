!(graphic pull-right)/images/blog/drone_400.png! 

This is a community driver bugfix release. If you have updated Arquillian Core to 1.1.3.Final, make sure to update Drone to this version.

I'd like to thank everybody involved in this release, especially to Juraj HÃºska and Tilmann Kuhn. _You guys make testing a breeze!_

h3. Drone 2.0.0.Alpha1 coming soon

Selenium 2.40.0 dropped support for @AndroidDriver@ and @iPhoneDriver@. We believe that this change should not affect Drone users that much, 
therefore we aim to make "Arquillian Droidium":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-droidium (based on "Selendroid":http://selendroid.io/), "ios-driver":http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/ and "Appium":http://appium.io/ a drop-in replacement for Android and iOS browser testing. While we try to keep backwards compatibility of Drone, underlaying changes to make this happen will form a baseline for Drone 2.0.0 release, roadmap coming soon. We'd need your help to make transition smooth and preserve backwards compatibility, so stay tuned!

h4. What happens with Drone 1.x ?

We'll drop non-supported browsers (Android, iOS) in Drone 1.3.0.Final. Because we'll keep releasing Selenium BOM, you will be able 
to "update Selenium to get latest browsers supported":https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HowDoISpecifyTheSeleniumVersionInArquillianDrone. Apart from Selenium updates, 
Drone 1.x branch will only get security and critical bug fixes.

We hope that you'll enjoy new stuff and look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
