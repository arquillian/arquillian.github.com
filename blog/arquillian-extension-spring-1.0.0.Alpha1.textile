We are moving the boundaries of Arquillian into completely new area by including build-in support for Spring Framework. This is the first release of extension so it's focusing mostly on  providing support for the Spring's core features.

h3(highlights). Some of the highlights in this release

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Dependency injection :=
The extension provides three simple ways to enable Spring support in Arquillian test case. In other to create application context from XML simply add to the test @@SpringConfiguration@ with locations of the XML files. Java-based config is supported as well with @@SpringAnnotatedConfiguration@ which can be configured with concrete classes or names of packages to scan. The last possibility, @@SpringWebConfiguration@ that allows to retrieve the application context of the specific DispatcherServlet running in the container, can be used only with web applications.

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Custom context classes :=
There are situations when plain Spring context isn't enough, so we allowed to register custom context classes that will be instantiated for each test. The context classes could be customized through annotations or through extension settings provided with arquillian.xml. A typical scenario would be for example running the Spring in JBoss AS using Snowdrop custom context classes.

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Artifact packaging :=
The extension, by default, handles packaging of spring-context and spring-web automatically with each test.

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Intuitive configuration :=
The extension can be easily configured through the arquillian.xml. All the settings like e.g. artifacts versions can be overridden here.

For examples on how to use these extensions and quickly get started with development you can take a look at prepared "showcases":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-showcase/spring. Additionally you can use the "integration tests":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-container-spring that are part of project source code.

For preparing this release I would like to especially thank "Dan Allen", "Marius Bogoevici" and "Aslak Knutsen" for sharing their knowledge and providing helping hand.

We look forward to hearing your feedback about this release in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}!
