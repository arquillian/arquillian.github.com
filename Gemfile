# This is a bundler configuration file (http://gembundler.com).
#
# Bundler makes it easy to make sure that your application has the dependencies
# it needs to start up and run without errors. It locates and installs the gems
# and their dependencies listed in this file, Gemfile.
#
# After installing any needed gems to your system, bundler writes a snapshot of
# all of the gems and versions that it installed to Gemfile.lock.
#
# Gemfile.lock makes your application a single package of both your own code
# and the third-party code so it remains stable in a known working state.
#
# To get started, first make sure you've installed bundler using gem install
# (or jgem install for JRuby):
#
# gem install bundler
#
# Then, use bundler to fetch the remaining libraries you'll need:
#
# bundle install
#
# Now, you're ready to start developing!
#
# awestruct -s
#
# Though if you want to be strict, you should execute in a bundle sandbox:
#
# bundle exec awestruct -s
